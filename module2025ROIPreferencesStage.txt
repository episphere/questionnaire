[INTROPREF] <b>Your Preferences for Receiving Study Results</b> 

Over time, we’ll share with you what we learn from Connect research. This survey asks about your preferences for the types of information Connect might share with you. Your input will help Connect make decisions about what to share with participants in the future.

The topics within this survey are examples of personal research results and study findings we may return. When we return results, participants will have the choice to view or decline their personal results report. We may decide not to return results on some of the topics in this survey.

For a few topics here, researchers do not yet know how the results may affect health, health care, or health-related decision-making. However, even with this uncertainty, we want to keep you informed about what we are learning from Connect research. We also want to share research information that means the most to you. Your voice matters- thank you for your participation!



[INTROGEO] <b>Neighborhood Information</b>

Knowing information about where you live may help you make more informed decisions about protecting your health and the health of your environment. Certain information, such as access to public transit, cost of living, and environmental pollution, can be linked to a specific geographic location. Researchers can collect these data for a specific location by using address information.  As part of a previous Connect survey, you may have already shared your address and where you’ve lived over the past 20 years.  This information allows researchers to study how social, physical, and man-made spaces may affect health outcomes. Data linked to location can also help researchers identify areas that may benefit from efforts to improve community health.

[INTROINDIVRISK] <b>Known Personal Cancer Risks and Those Still Under Study</b>

Current and future Connect surveys will ask about things in daily life that may affect cancer risk, including some we already know about and others that scientists are still exploring as potential risks. We may share a report with you that shows how your survey answers compare to the general population, and how your behavior compares to health guidelines. We may also share averages across the entire community of Connect participants. The items below may affect cancer risk or are being studied for their potential risks.

[INTROGENETICS] <b>Genetic Traits</b>

Through the process of studying your DNA, scientists may uncover information about your genes that isn't directly related to your health. For example, your genes may predict whether you:
* Have a high sensitivity to bitter foods
* Perceive cilantro as tasting “soapy” 
* Are lactose intolerant 
* Have wet or dry earwax 
* Smell an unfamiliar odor in urine after eating asparagus

[INTRORSRCHDISC] <b>Research Discoveries in Connect</b>

Studies like Connect often lead to new discoveries, but scientists need to confirm and carefully interpret the findings before they can be considered conclusive. Study findings may not be definitive, for example, when studies are still ongoing, or when scientists are debating the findings.  Some people may want to learn about new research discoveries, even if they are not definitive, while others may not. There is no right or wrong answer. It’s about your personal preference.

Scientists are developing new tests that may find cancers earlier when they are easier to treat. These new tests are called Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) tests. The tests are designed to find more than one type of cancer from a single blood sample. Scientists are still evaluating how well MCED tests work.

[D_151535519?] How interested would you be in learning more about Multi-Cancer Early Detection tests given that scientists are unsure of how well they work right now?
