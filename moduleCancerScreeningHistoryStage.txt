[SRVSCR_ORSCREENINT_V1R0] <b>Oral Cancer Screening</b>
Oral cancer screening is an examination performed by a dentist or healthcare professional to look for cancer in your mouth. This is different from a regular check-up at your dentist. 

During an oral cancer screening, your provider may do one or both of the following exams: a visual exam in which the provider looks inside your mouth for patches or mouth sores, and a physical exam in which the provider feels for lumps or bumps in your mouth. Your provider may also ask you to rinse your mouth with a special blue dye that highlights abnormal tissue, or use a special light to make abnormal tissue appear white.
